Thanks for your interest in `clim-recal` data and metrics. We plan to release a set of combined observation and simulation datasets for three cities in the UK and invite authors of bias correction methods to benchmark their methods for those cities.

We are still completing this work. As soon as the data are ready for publication, we will update this page with information on how to access them - check back soon.

In the meantime, please check [our blog article](https://urban-analytics-technology-platform.github.io/blog/platform_v2_release/) describing this work.
