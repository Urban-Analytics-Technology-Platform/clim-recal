Workflow diagram

<!--
Note a syntax error is raised if referencing the `mermaid` file in `docs/assets/`.
Ideally this gets resolved to simply import that file here like so:
```{mermaid}
{% include assets/pipeline.mermaid %}
````
-->

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-outdated-workflow
%%| fig-cap: "A diagram of the previous workflow."
%%| file: assets/pipeline.mermaid
```
